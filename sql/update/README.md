# MariaDB setup

This directory hosts any new SQL table added to genenetwork3. When preparing
statements, be sure to follow [this](https://www.sqlstyle.guide/) style guide.

Also, not that in some tables, we use the json data format; therefore make
sure you have MariaDB version 10.2 and later which include a range of JSON
supporting functions. Read about that
