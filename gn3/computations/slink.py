    Computes shortest distance between member(s) in `i` and member(s) in `j`.

    Description:
    This is 'copied' over from genenetwork1, from
    https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork1/blob/master/web/webqtl/heatmap/slink.py#L42-L64.

    This description should be updated to better describe what 'member' means in
    the context where the function is used.

    Parameters:
    lists (list of lists of distances): Represents a list of members and their
        distances from each other.
        Each inner list represents the distances the member at that coordinate
        is from other members in the list: for example, a member at index 0 with
        the values [0, 9, 1, 7] indicates that the member is:
        - 0 units of distance away from itself
        - 9 units of distance away from member at coordinate 1
        - 1 unit of distance away from member at coordinate 2
        - 7 units of distance away from member at coordinate 3
    i (int or list of ints): Represents the coordinate of a member, or a list of
        coordinates of members on the `lists` list.
    j (int or list of ints): Represents the coordinate of a member, or a list of
        coordinates of members on the `lists` list.

    Returns:
    int: Represents the shortest distance between member(s) in `i` and member(s)
        in `j`."""

    DESCRIPTION:
    TODO: Not quite sure what this function does. Work through the code with a
        fine tooth comb, once we understand the context of its use, so as to
        give a better description

        The name of the function does not clearly establish what the function
        does either, meaning, once that is established, the function should be
        renamed to give the user an idea of what it does without necessarily
        reading through a ton of code.

        We should also look into refactoring the function to reduce/eliminate
        the multiple levels of nested-loops and conditionals

    PARAMETERS:
    lists (list of lists of numbers): Give this a better name.
        Each item of this list is a list of coordinates of the members in the
        group.
        What 'member' and 'group' in this context means, is not yet established.
